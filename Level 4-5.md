# Level 4->5 

Objective: The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.


1. ls -alps is used to see what files are available. The directory "inhere" can be seen. Check the directory using cd.

2. using ls -alps again we see multiple files named "-file00" to"-file09".

3. search for the file with txt extension (human readable).

4. use file ./* to get file types listed. Shows that file07 has ASCII format which means it is txt file.

5. use cat to check file07
